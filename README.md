# FuMOGAE
FuMOGAE project description
The Dataset folder contains three configurations derived from two major breast cancer
cohorts—TCGA-BRCA and METABRIC. The TCGA-BRCA dataset consists of 951 patient
samples and provides seven complementary modalities: Clinical data, Copy Number
Alteration (CNA), Gene Expression (GSE), DNA Methylation, miRNA Expression,
Somatic Mutation profiles, and Co-expression features.

The METABRIC dataset contains 1,253 patient samples with five modalities, namely
Clinical data, CNA, Gene Expression, DNA Methylation, and miRNA Expression. This
dataset is used to train and evaluate the ChoqSugFuzGAE model under a reduced-modal
setting.

A combined cohort of 2,204 patients is generated by merging TCGA-BRCA and METABRIC,
where three modalities—Clinical, CNA, and Gene Expression—are commonly available
across both datasets. This merged dataset is used to study cross-cohort generalization
and model robustness.

For all configurations, the provided breast cancer subtype labels (LumA, LumB,
Her2-enriched, Basal-like, and Normal) serve as ground truth for evaluating the
multi-modal classification framework.
